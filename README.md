# Roguelike

A Rogue cloning engine written in Ruby

Roguelike is intended to be a full engine capable of running clones of the 1980 game Rogue. Users will eventually be able to simply provide a series of maps they've created and Roguelike will handle all of the logic of the game. In this way, someone who wants to create their own version of Rogue simply needs to design their dungeons, layout the enemies and treasures, and let Roguelike do the rest.
